# Role Based Authentication using Laravel and Angular JS

We will be creating a role-based authentication system in Laravel by using JWT(JSON Web Tokens) and Laravel Entrust Library. Further, we will use angular js front-end. As of date, no JWT libraries provide the role-based authentication. Hence we will be using a little trick to deal with the role-based applications. Adding authentication to Angular Js and Laravel application is neither pretty straightforward nor very complex, we will be using Laravel exposed API's to achieve that, since we will be creating a totally independent front-end and back-end.
